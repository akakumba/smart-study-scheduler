name: Smart Study Scheduler
description: >
  An AI agent that generates a personalized learning schedule based on a user’s goal, timeframe, and preferred learning style (visual, reading, interactive).
  The agent uses hooks to break the topic into subtopics, allocate content across a calendar, and fetch matching learning resources from APIs like YouTube or blogs.

goals:
  - Take a user input like: "I want to learn JavaScript in 3 weeks, 1 hour per day. I'm a visual learner."
  - Analyze the topic and break it into logical daily learning steps.
  - Adjust pacing based on total duration and hours per day.
  - Prioritize resources that match the user’s learning style.
  - Use the YouTube API (or simulated data for demo) to find videos for each topic segment.
  - Format output into a structured schedule (e.g. Day 1: Topic + Link).
  - Optionally export to calendar format or print to console.

inputs:
  - topic (string): The subject to learn (e.g. "JavaScript")
  - duration_weeks (number): How many weeks the user wants to study
  - hours_per_day (number): Daily commitment
  - learning_style (string): Preferred format (e.g. "visual", "reading", "interactive")

outputs:
  - A structured study schedule (JSON or Markdown)
  - Learning resource links mapped to subtopics
  - (Optional) Calendar-ready format (e.g. .ics, or daily log)

hooks:
  - fetchResources: Looks up YouTube or blog content matching the topic and user style
  - calendarHook (optional): Formats output into a calendar-friendly format
  - suggestFallbacks: If no content is found, offer backup topics or generic resources

requirements:
  - Output should be human-readable and structured
  - Should handle edge cases (e.g., short timelines or vague topics)
  - Designed for developers or students who want structured self-paced learning
